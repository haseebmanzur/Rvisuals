# Rvisuals: A Comprehensive R-based Data Visualization Repository

**Rvisuals** is a personal collection of R scripts that I have developed for generating publication-ready visualizations. Designed for data scientists, researchers, and analysts, these scripts offer reproducible and insightful visual representations of data for analysis and reporting..

---

## Key Features

- **Organized Structure**: Each visualization type is stored in dedicated folders containing clear Input, Script, and Plot subfolders.
- **Easy-to-use**: Plug-and-play R scripts tailored to diverse visualization requirements.
- **Publication-Quality**: Generate high-resolution graphics ready for reports, presentations, and research publications.

## üõ† Installation & Dependencies

Ensure you have R installed and then run:

```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse", "ggpubr", "patchwork"))
```

---

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to create visualizations:

1. Navigate to your desired visualization folder (e.g., `3. Heatmaps`).
2. Place your dataset into the `Input/` folder.
3. Execute the R script found in the `Script/` folder:


## Visualization Examples

-  **Raincloud Plot**: Effectively visualize distributions with combined density, boxplots, and scatter plots.

-  **Heatmap**: Intuitive visualization of matrix data for rapid insights.
