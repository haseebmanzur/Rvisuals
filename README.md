## 🛠 Installation & Dependencies

Ensure you have R installed and then run:

```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse", "ggpubr", "patchwork"))
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to create visualizations:

1. Navigate to your desired visualization folder (e.g., `3. Heatmaps`).
2. Place your dataset into the `Input/` folder.
3. Execute the R script found in the `Script/` folder:

```R
source("Script/heatmap.R")  # Generates a heatmap using ggplot2
```

4. Your publication-quality plot will be saved automatically in the `Plots/` folder.

## 🎨 Visualization Examples

- 🌧️ **Raincloud Plot**: Effectively visualize distributions with combined density, boxplots, and scatter plots.
- 🎻 **Violin Plot**: Clearly display data distributions and statistical summaries.
- 🔥 **Heatmap**: Intuitive visualization of matrix data for rapid insights.
- 🔗 **Correlation Heatmap**: Identify and showcase correlations clearly and succinctly.
- 📦 **Association Boxplots**: Highlight relationships between categorical variables and continuous outcomes.

*(Make sure to include actual visual examples in your repository!)*
